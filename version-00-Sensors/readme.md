# Version 00

I love to cook and make new recipes, it's best when you're cooking with fresh food.

I always hear and research garden automation but never did, and now I decided to learn IoT, using NodeMCU, C++ and others, and make my own garden following tutorials and tips on the web.

Nothing better than cooking with fresh vegetables, which will be taken care of by an automated system ;) Let's start ...

## Main Idea

I'm begin to study on the C++ and NodeMCU this year, so I'm developing small slice of code to testing and debug easily. This way, I developed a humidity and temperature controll on NodeMCU and soil humidy controll on Arduino One.
