# Version 00

I love to cook and make new recipes, it's best when you're cooking with fresh food.

I always hear and research garden automation but never did it, and now I decided to learn IoT, using NodeMCU, C++ and others, and make my own garden following tutorials and tips on the web.

Nothing better than cooking with fresh vegetables, which will be taken care of by an automated system ;) Let's start ...

## Main Idea

I'm begin to study on the C++ and NodeMCU this year, so I'm developing small slice of code to testing and debug easily. This way, I developed a humidity and temperature controll on NodeMCU and soil humidy controll on Arduino Uno.

Every day, I'm plugging soil sensor five times in a diferente vases, why? Because, I have five diferente plants, each one have a vase and I need to measure the each soil's humidity to controll and kwon how many water I'll irrigate each one. Every day I open the sheet and complete humidity percentual the plants, also temperature and air humidity.

I'm plugging the NodeMCU too, everyday to register the temperature and humidity for complete the same sheet and compose the data.

Below, show the two schema or flow for understand how simple is it, and understand how I organize ideas and will upgrade the project, their evolution.
