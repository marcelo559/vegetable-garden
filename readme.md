# Understanding the project

For study, learn and undertand Arduino I will try to developed a code for automatization my vegetable garden at home.

With lean mindset, I to sliced the project in features. Look:

`First stage` => Version 00 -> I developed two separated code. The Arduino One board I'm  use measure the soil humidy and the NodeMCU ESP32 board I use to mesure the temperature (degrees Celsius) and humity (%).

`Second stage` => Version 01 -> I'm developing the automatization of irrigation, each 24 hours I will irrigate plants using a pump;

`Third stage` => Version 02 -> I will data (soil and air humidy and temperature) record in a data base using ESP32;

`Fourth stage` => Version 03 -> In this stage I will mix the version 01 and 02, the system will capture humidy (soil and air) record in data base, and identify if plats need or not water (irrigation);

`Fifth stage` => Version 04 -> I will use clean energy for powered the system;

`Sixth stage` => Version 05 -> I would like to colected rain water to irrigate the plants;

`Seventh stage`=> Version 06 -> I would like to automatization the home made pesticide's irrigation for control aphids and mealybugs;

`Eighth stage`=> Version 07 -> I would like to automatization the fertilizer's irrigation;
